Description
This is a basic first person shooter, it has minimal graphics and basic controls. The aim is to survive until the clock runs down.

•	Main actions
o	The main action of the game is shooting (left click). The player fires projectiles that damage the ai characters on impact. If the ai sustains enough damage, they are killed. 

There are two other actions in the game. The first of which is moving with the wasd keys and the second is jumping using the space bar.

•	Challenges
o	The most challenging aspect of the project was getting the ai to shoot at the player. This involved setting up hit detection on the player and getting the ai to shoot in the right direction. This was particularly challenging because the ai has to predict where the player will be in order to shoot accurately. Underneath this involved vector artithmatic which is tricky to get right. 


•	Interesting
o	I thought that animations were three most interesting part of the project. I enjoyed bruising the Epic marketplace and Adobe stores for animations and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and variety that was available.
